It's fucking disgusting. It's so disgusting I can't hold myself anymore.

To date, there are total 4 successful hlotus solo in Blackguard. 3 out of 4 are using dark sight, and the people are congratulating those so called 'idols/ senpais' for solo-ing hlotus. Jesus Christ, the more I see this, the more it disgusts me. Really??? Dark sight? You call that an achievement? You even feel proud for using dark sight to solo hard bosses? Nani the fuck? Grow up man, you all dark sight users should muster up courage to clear hard bosses like a real man. To be honest when I click into the video, the moment I saw you use dark sight, I close the video immediately, I don't even bother watching your mechanic, your solo run is corrupted, filthy, contaminated, an abomination, a cheat play. You should know just how unworthy you are. To date, I only consider Nio's Hard Lotus Solo without dark sight as the real hlotus solo run, and also it should be considered as FIRST hlotus solo in Blackguard. The video posted on April 16 2021, any hlotus solo before this date is considered invalid.

To hlotus solo attempters, if you solo-ed hlotus with dark sight, don't fucking post your run publicly man. For fuck sake, you're destroying other players' will of honing boss mechanics. Y'all viewers should also stop congratulating dark sight users for solo-ing hard bosses, 请不要用你们盲目的爱，给予她/他无限的力量。

Dark sight. Haha. Kid's Protection Skill.

To the readers, prepare popcorn, those dark sight crybabies are coming.
